Business Process
Requirements To understand the effects of a potential $15 congestion charge on Metro Bike Share usage, data from 2023 will be analyzed.
Collect trip-specific data, such as durations, start and end points, and frequencies.
Profile the data to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average duration and distances of trips, potentially inferring the cost differences for commuters.
Use the Metro Bike Share trip data (Q3 2023) as the primary dataset.
Incorporate comparative cost data for alternative transportation methods if available.
